# Remove Page Numbers and Headers
This is to remove the page numbers and headers from a book that I scanned and converted to text. It is nothing spectacular, other than I don't want to have to figure this out again in the future. This is similar to other projects that I have done in the past.

# Usage
Call the script with script name and file you want to process. i.e., remove_pg_no.py FILENAME.txt

The file will read from and write back into the same file. Therefore, you may want to do this on a second copy of the original.
